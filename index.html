            Here you find a list of all courses I attended at <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETHZ</a> as a computer science student.
            I also added a short review to (almost) each course listing, because one thing I always missed at ETHZ was a public course review board.
            Of course there is the <a href="https://ergebnisseub.sp.ethz.ch">exam evaluation</a> where you can get some information about the courses, or one can ask friends in higher semesters.
            However, as the name suggests the exam evaluation focuses on the exam, and your friends might not have taken the course you're interested in.
            Naturally, you could also ask online, but that isn't as comfortable.
            I was thinking about implementing such a site myselves.
            However, such a site requires moderation and I am not really interested in maintaining such a website.
            Adding short reviews to my site, on the other hand, is simple and might help someone in choosing a course.
            If you have questions about a course, feel free to <a href="mailto:%6C%6F%72%69%73%2E%72%65%69%66%66%40%6D%61%69%6C%62%6F%78%2E%6F%72%67">drop me a line</a>.

              <p>
                  The course was nicely structured.
                  However, the intuition of the definition was often missing for me and I wished that some geometric interpretations would have been covered.
                  The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of linear algebra</a> by 3Blue1Brown is in my opinion a good addition to the course.
                  Also I believe a bit more material should be covered in order to prepare better for e.g. Numerical Methods for CSE.

              <p>
                  Discrete Mathematics was one of my favorite courses in the <em>Basisjahr</em>.
                  Prof. Maurer has a really captivating way of teaching and he knows how to display the beauty of mathematics.
                  This course is in general a great introduction to <em>mathematical thinking</em> and proofs.
                  I truly enjoyed this course!

              <p>
                  I already knew how to program prior to the begin of my studies, so this course was rather easy.
                  That's why I'd suggest to already take a GESS course in the first semester if you have programming experience.
                  I'd say the course provides a solid introduction to programming, but that is difficult to judge with experience.

              <p>
                  P. Widmayer is a great teacher!
                  It is a bit unfortunal that he retired.
                  He really knows how to intuitively explain algorithms on a blackboard in an interesting manner.
                  Algorithms and Data Structures is great course and in my view it strikes the balance between theory and practice perfectly.

                  This course continues where <em>Algorithms and Data Structures</em> left off.
                  It is maybe a bit more theoretical than A&amp;D, but not less interesting!
                  When I took the course, it was completely new and had some rough corners.
                  However, A. Steger was keen on our feedback, and I am sure the initial issues were fixed.
                  I highly enjoyed this course.

                  One can really feel O. Mutlu's passion for computer achitecture when attending the lectures!
                  What's nice, he references to a lot of papers as additional reading which is great if you are interested in the topic.
                  Also most if not all of his lectures are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwQ8uOeRFgOEvBLYc3kc3g/playlists">online</a>.
                  On a negative note he tended not to end on time.

              <p>
                  Whenever I have a race condition in my code I think back to this course.
                  Concurrency and parallelism is hard and this course gives a little glimpse into that.
                  It is definitely a helpful course!
                  Unfortunate the structure of the course was sometimes a bit confusing and parts of the material got covered twice, once by by T. Hoefler and once by M. Vechev.
                  From the theoretical side some parts could be formalized slightly more.
                  And from a practical perspective it would be nice to cover some concurrency issue in a real world application.

                  Contrary to linear algebra, Ö. Imamoglu tried to cover the intuition of definitions if relevant, which I liked.
                  I enjoyed the course, even though there is a number of computer scientist students are not particularly fond of analysis.

                  This course is a natural continuation from Analysis I.
                  So similary comments apply.
                  The only additional critic is that Ö. Imamoglu's timetable didn't work out.
                  At the end of the course we flew over interesting (and important) topics, which is a little unfortunate.

                  This course is a bit of a mixed bag.
                  It was the first time R. Alaifari taught this course and she clearly put a lot of effort in it to explain the material in a understandable way.
                  Also there are many important take aways from the course.
                  However, I felt like the connection between subtopics of this course were not always clear and the problems could have been motivated more extensively.

                  If you are curious about low level programming, you are going to love this course!
                  The lectures as well as the assignments are great.
                  What's great about T. Roscoe is that he spikes the course with interesting anecdotes from the past.
                  However, if you are less excited about system programming you might consider his stories a negative point, as he sometimes gets lost in them.
                  Which means you have to review more material on your own.

                  Students with a strong maths background usually find the course not too challenging.
                  Computer scientists that are more engineering focused might need to invest a bit more time.
                  At least this was my impression when I was a teaching assistant for this course.
                  What is nice about the course is that you don't have a session exam, but a mid- and end-term exam.

                  Some lectures were also helpful, but the lecturing style was occasionally a bit dull.

                  At the time of taking the course, the tension was rising between North Korea and the USA, because of North Korea's missile tests.
                  The material was really up to date and was true to its name.
                  Treaties and issues of this conflict were included in the lectures.
                  Furthermore, the course was quite broad.

                  While it was the first time that this course wasn't taught as "Operating Systems and Networks", it made a very well structured impression.
                  I also appreciated the projects.
                  It helped me to gasp the theory even better.

                  Personally I found the course a bit dull.
                  The material taught is very valuable indeed, but the lecture didn't spark joy for me.
                  I often didn't go the lecture and read the corresponding pages in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/236665.Database_Systems">suggested book</a> instead.

                  This course repeated some of the essential theorems in probability which were covered in "Algorithms and Probability" and introduced some basic ideas from statistics.
                  In hindsight I wish we covered more statistics and motivated the ideas and concepts more.

              <p>
                  This course is 50&#37; great and 50&#37; <i>meh</i>.
                  The great part is the functional programming one, where David Basin introduces Haskell.
                  If you like maths and programming you will enjoy haskell.
                  Furthermore, I found D. Basin's humor to be great, but your mileage may vary.
                  As you may have guessed, the <i>meh</i> part is about formal methods.
                  Formal methods is absolutely not semi-formal...
                  A big part of the exercises is writing formal induction proofs by hand, which gets boring pretty quickly.
                  I think a bit more computer aided verification and computer based proofs would greatly improve the course.

              <p><strong>Credits:</strong> 4</p>
              <p><strong>Taught by:</strong> A. Imamoglu</p>
              <p>The old regulation of the computer science bachelor had an obligatory physics lecture.
                  I felt like not having to take physics was a big loss.
                  And since I enjoyed physics in high school, I took this course as a minor (Ergänzung) without giving it much thought.
                  This turned out to be a mistake, almost all topics were covered during high school (at least if you took PAM).
                  In this course we derived a bit more formulas, and the difficulty level was also a bit higher than in high school.
                  However, I wanted to gain additional insight not repeat thermodynamics and friends.
                  So read the course description carefully, otherwise you'll end up like me sitting through a course without much joy.

                  What I enjoyed in this course that it was thought by many different professors.
                  Each one presented topics they liked particularly, at least that was my impression.
                  So their passion might spark over to you.
                  The course can be seen as continuation of "Algorithms and Data Structures" and "Algorithms and Probability" without the applied part.
                  Ergo it is a theory course.
                  In comparison to the other core courses I have taken, I would say that APC is more demanding.
                  But the introduced topics are interesting, and some are helpful for the notorious AlgoLab course.

                  If you enjoyed <a href="#spca">SPCA</a>, you will also enjoy the part taught by T. Roscoe in this course.
                  Important operating system concepts are covered in a abstract, general manner and examples to implementations are given.
                  The distributed systems part is a bit detached from the operating systems part.
                  At least this was the case in the first iteration of the course.
                  Personally, I enjoyed the operating system part better, but this is also linked to my interests.
                  The distributed system part is certainly a solid introduction to the topic.
                  In terms of effort this course is roughly in the middle compared to the core courses.

              <p>
                  The course is split into a visual computing and a computer graphics part.
                  M. Pollefeys introduces many different visual computing techniques on a high-level.
                  In my opinion those high-level explanation are not enough to truly understand the material (but enough to pass, if you're worried about that ;).
                  I would suggest reading the corresponding chapters in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196018.Digital_Image_Processing">Digital Image Processing</a> by R. C. Gonzalez and R. E. Woods,
                  if you want to get more out of the first part.
                  The second part starts slow.
                  However, it felt like all important building blocks are introduced.
                  In comparison to other core courses, I'd rate the effort as below average.

                  A. Gunzinger is a really friendly guy.
                  However, his course felt more like a high-school class.
                  Not that this is bad, but 6 ECTS are not really justifed in my opinion.
                  Also it is simpler to get a good grade in comparison to other courses.
                  He even mentioned that the secretary complained about this.
                  You will still learn a thing or two, but it is not comparable to a lecture by O. Mutlu!

                  This lecture is also split into two parts.
                  In the first S. Capkun introduces cryptography, in the second D. Basin presents divers topics such as protocol security, network security and anonymity.
                  I found the first part to be a bit slow paced, but important concepts of modern cryptography are introduced.
                  To get an even deeper understanding the recommended <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1529053.Introduction_to_Modern_Cryptography">book</a> felt like a good companion.
                  The second part had a good pace for me and was presented interestingly.
                  The effort for this course is roughly the average with regards to core courses.
                  Another cool aspect of the course was the optional CTF organized by E. Mohammadi.

                  Furthermore, the biweekly projects are a great way to apply the learned techniques and contribute to the understanding.
